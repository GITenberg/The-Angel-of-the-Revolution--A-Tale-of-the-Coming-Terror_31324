description: "The Angel of the Revolution: A Tale of the Coming Terror (1893) is a\
  \ science fiction novel by the English writer George Griffith. It was his first\
  \ published novel and remains his most famous work. It was first published in Pearson's\
  \ Weekly and was prompted by the success of \"The Great War of 1892\" in Black and\
  \ White magazine, which was itself inspired by The Battle of Dorking.\nA lurid mix\
  \ of Jules Verne's futuristic air warfare fantasies, the utopian visions of News\
  \ from Nowhere and the future war invasion literature of Chesney and his imitators,\
  \ it told the tale of a group of self-styled 'terrorists' who conquer the world\
  \ through airship warfare. Led by a crippled, brilliant Russian Jew and his daughter,\
  \ the 'angel' Natasha, 'The Brotherhood of Freedom' establish a 'pax aeronautica'\
  \ over the earth after a young inventor masters the technology of flight in 1903.\
  \ The hero falls in love with Natasha and joins in her war against established society\
  \ in general and the Russian Czar in particular [1].\nIt is characterised by what\
  \ Michael Moorcock called its \"controlled imaginative flight\", essentially socialist\
  \ message and a strongly romantic air. Griffith's \"pro nihilist\" stance was examined\
  \ in a piece entitled \"Terrorism in the Late Victorian Novel\" by Barbara Arnett\
  \ Melchiori which appeared in The Modern Language Review. A sequel, The Syren of\
  \ the Skies appeared in Pearson's Weekly and was published in book form as Olga\
  \ Romanoff in 1894.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
